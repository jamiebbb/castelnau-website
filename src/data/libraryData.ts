    description: "Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness. Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave.",
    summary: "Morgan Housel explores how psychology affects financial decisions more than financial knowledge. Through a series of short stories, he illustrates that successful investing is less about technical skills and more about behavior, patience, and the right mindset. The book emphasizes that personal history, unique experiences, and worldview shape how individuals interact with money, often in ways that traditional economic theory fails to capture."
